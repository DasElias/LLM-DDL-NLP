  <GeneratedElementDescriptions>complaint(X): Supplier has received a complaint from a customer.  
expressDissatisfaction(X): Customer expresses dissatisfaction with the progress or resolution of their complaint.

**Key details:**  
1. Two trigger atoms (expressDissatisfaction/askFurtherOptions) capture customer actions that activate the requirement  
2. Separate consequence atoms for each mandated disclosure (internal process and external options)  
3. Base complaint(X) atom establishes the prerequisite context of an existing complaint  
4. Atoms avoid negations and follow "simple breakdown" principle (e.g., separating escalation info from external options info)</GeneratedElementDescriptions><Generated><Paragraph paragraphLabel="8.2.1.c">
