<!-- 
Rationale: 
1. Reused existing atoms "complaint(X)", "urgent(X)", and "unresolved(X)" from the provided list
2. Used "informedResolution(X)" as the closest existing atom to represent communication about delay reasons (though imperfect, maintains consistency with existing vocabulary)
3. Split into two rules to handle urgent/non-urgent cases without disjunction
4. Maintains the requirement structure by making urgency a precondition rather than part of the consequence
5. Avoids temporal aspects (deadlines) by encoding urgency status in preconditions

</Paragraph>

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Atoms Identification:**  
   - Reused existing atom: `acceptedByConsumer(X)` (covers consent requirement).  
   - New atom: `clauses8_2_1_c_d_e_complied(X)` (represents compliance with referenced clauses c/d/e since their exact content isn't provided in the input).

2. **Rule Structure:**  
   - **Prohibition:** Closing is forbidden unless consent exists or clauses c/d/e are met.  
   - **Permissions:** Closing is permitted when either consent exists (`acceptedByConsumer`) or clauses are complied with.

3. **Deontic Modalities:**  
   - `[F]` for prohibition on unauthorized closure.  
   - `[P]` for permissions when valid closure conditions exist.

4. **DDL Formalization:**  
   - Split into three rules to avoid disjunctive antecedents, ensuring each rule has a single consequence. Maintains validity by keeping antecedents simple and non-overlapping with consequences.</Generated></Paragraph>

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**
1. Reused existing atoms: 
   - urgent(X) captures the request for urgent treatment
   - complaint(X) as foundational predicate
   - unresolved(X) for post-escalation dissatisfaction
   - adviseExternalDisputeResolution(X) from predefined list

2. Simplified structure by:
   - Treating timeframe dissatisfaction as equivalent to unresolved status after processes
   - Combining internal prioritization/escalation notification into single informInternalProcesses(X) atom
   - Using unresolved(X) to trigger external resolution advice per paragraph's second condition

3. Split into two obligations:
   - First handles urgent complaints and dissatisfaction triggers
   - Second handles post-process unresolved status requiring external options</Generated></Paragraph>
