Key decomposition:
1. Atomic splitting aligned with style guide:
   - complaint(X) (core context)
   - urgent(X) (split from Urgent Complaint reference)
   - -canResolveWithin15Days(X) (negated resolution capability for standard timeline)
   - -canResolveUrgentWithin2Days(X) (negated resolution capability for urgent timeline)
   - beforeWorkingDay15/2(X) (temporal conditions from deadlines)

2. Structural patterns:
   - Dual rules mirror Example 8's handling of standard/urgent differentiation
   - Negation operator (-) follows Example 3's prohibition pattern
   - Temporal atoms maintain consistency with Example 7's "withinXDays" convention

Key decomposition:
1. Atomic splitting per style guide:
   - complaint(X) (core context)
   - dissatisfiedTimeframes(X) (split from "dissatisfied with timeframes")
   - requestUrgentTreatment(X) (split from "seek to have treated as Urgent")
   - internalPrioritizationDone(X) + internalEscalationDone(X) (split process steps)
   - stillDissatisfied(X) (post-escalation state)

2. Structural alignment:
   - First two rules handle OR conditions via separate rules (Examples 5/6 approach)
   - Third rule combines sequential process requirements (Example 13's multi-condition pattern)
   - Obligations ([O]) match "must tell" directives

3. Validation:
   - No antecedent atoms in consequences
   - Each rule maintains single consequence
   - Complies with XML schema from prior conversions
   - Captures escalation sequence through atomic predicates

8.2.1 A Supplier must take the following actions to enable this outcome:
  (c) Respond to dissatisfaction with progress or outcome: If a Consumer or former Customer tells the Supplier that they are dissatisfied with the progress or Resolution of a Complaint or asks about their options to pursue a Complaint further, the Supplier must tell them about:
      (i) the Supplier's internal escalation process; and 
      (ii) the options for external dispute resolution including the TIO.

<!-- 
Key decomposition:
1. Atomic splitting aligned with style guide:
   - complaint(X) (core context)
   - Three trigger conditions split into atomic predicates:
     * dissatisfiedProgress(X)
     * dissatisfiedResolution(X)
     * requestFurtherOptions(X)
   - Two distinct consequences for required disclosures:
     * informInternalEscalation(X)
     * informExternalOptions(X)

2. Structural patterns:
   - 6 rules mirror 8.2.1.b's approach of handling OR conditions via separate rules
   - Maintains 1:1 trigger-consequence mapping per rule (no disjunctive antecedents)
   - Follows Example 3's pattern for multiple obligations from same base context

3. Validation:
   - No antecedent atoms in consequences
   - Each rule enforces single obligation ([O])
   - Complies with XML schema from prior conversions
   - Captures "must tell about both (i) AND (ii)" through parallel rule sets
